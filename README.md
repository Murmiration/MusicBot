# SwissBot: Very much a WIP

MusicBot was originally just a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.
Hopefully as time goes on we'll add more features to the bot and update the existing code.

Please note that the people working on this are very much ameteurs, don't expect this project to get anywhere anytime soon.
